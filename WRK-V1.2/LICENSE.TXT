a license that complies with this license.

4.  If you have modified the software or created derivative works,
and distribute such modifications or derivative works, you will cause
the modified files to carry prominent notices describing your changes and
the date of the changes, so that recipients know that they are not receiving
the original software.

5.  THE SOFTWARE COMES "AS IS", WITH NO WARRANTIES. THIS MEANS NO EXPRESS,
IMPLIED OR STATUTORY WARRANTY, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES
OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR ANY WARRANTY
OF TITLE OR NON-INFRINGEMENT. YOU MUST PASS THIS DISCLAIMER ON WHENEVER

7.  If you sue anyone over patents that you think may apply to the software
or anyone's use of the software, your license to the software ends immediately.

programs that are designed to: (a) harm or intentionally interfere with
the operation of a computer system including any data or information stored
on such computer system; and/or (b) surreptitiously gain or maintain high level
access to a computer system, self-propagate, and/or execute in a manner that
